/*
 There is an 8x8 chess board 
 in which two diagonally opposite corners have been cut off. 
 You are given 31 dominos, 
 and a single domino can cover exactly two squares. 
 Can you use the 31 dominos to cover the entire board? 
 Prove your answer 
 (by providing an example or showing why it's impossible).

solution:
	If we make the board white and black alternatively, then there are 32 black and 32 white square, if we cut off the corner ,then the corner have same color, so the white and black will not equal, so can not be covered by 31 dominos.
