/*
 You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, 
 and an unlimited supply of water (but no measuring cups). 
 How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? 
 Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, 
 such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

solution:
	If the two jugs' capacity are both prime number, then the capacity from 1 to jug1_cap+jug2_cap can be came up.
