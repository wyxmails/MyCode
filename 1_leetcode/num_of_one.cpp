Number of 1 Bits Total Accepted: 12135 Total Submissions: 32972 My Submissions Question Solution 
Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.
